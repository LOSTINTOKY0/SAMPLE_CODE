Commands:
  print:          shows contents of the tree in reverse sorted order
  clear:          eliminates all elements from the tree
  quit:           exit the program
  add <name>:     inserts the given string into the tree, duplicates ignored
  find <name>:    prints FOUND if the name is in the tree, NOT FOUND otherwise
  preorder:       prints contents of the tree in pre-order which is how it will be saved
  save <file>:    writes the contents of the tree in pre-order to the given file
  load <file>:    clears the current tree and loads the one in the given file
